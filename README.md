Description : 
This project implements a Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB (JPDB) to store, retrieve, and update student data. The form captures essential student details, such as Roll-No, Full Name, Class, Date of Birth, Address, and Enrollment Date. Based on the provided Roll-No, it either fetches existing student data from the database or allows users to save new data into the database.

The integration of JsonPowerDB enables seamless interaction with the database, utilizing simple and efficient API calls for storing and retrieving records. The form also provides options for updating existing records.

Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB:

Fast and Simple: JsonPowerDB provides a RESTful API interface to access and manipulate JSON data, making the process fast and efficient.

NoSQL Support: JPDB is a NoSQL database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage without the need for complex table structures.

Real-time Interaction: It offers real-time updates, allowing immediate reflection of changes when interacting with student data.
Ease of Integration: JsonPowerDBâ€™s API can be easily integrated with web forms and applications for quick data processing.

No Server-side Setup Required: No need for complex server-side database management systems as JPDB handles data storage and retrieval seamlessly via APIs.
